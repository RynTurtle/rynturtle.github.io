In February I will be doing a game jam, a 24hr group project where we will create games based on a theme given to us, I’m excited to give this a go and will be a fun challenge since I haven’t learned unity or unreal engine, I’m hoping I will get some good experience working as a team and to program in a time restricted fast paced environment. I will give an update once it has finished and explain what the theme was and how it all went.
