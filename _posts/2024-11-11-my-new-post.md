<h3>
For my first programming assignment in university, I had to create a program in C++ with 100 lines of code using basic input and output, I chose to create an interaction at a fruit stall for the user to purchase any type of fruit they want. 
</h3>

My fruit stall Program’s features are:
<ul>
	<li>Asks how much money you have and stores in a variable. </li>
    <li>Farmer asks if you want fruit, if you do then it will display the fruits and prices, if you don’t then it will cancel. </li>
	<li>Ascii Image of a farmer displayed with fruit and price next to it.  </li>
    <li> When some fruit is selected it will check if you can afford it then it will take the price off the wallet, if you can’t afford it then the program will cancel.</li>
    <li>Displays certain text in colour e.g. When a fruit is bought the writing is in green. </li>
    <li>When the program ends it will open a text document displaying the receipt with fruit bought and price with total spent.</li>
</ul>


<h3> Here is the video explaining each line of code I created for my assignment. </h3>
