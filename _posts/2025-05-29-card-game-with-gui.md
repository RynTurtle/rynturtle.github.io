For my final first year university project I was challenged to create a simple card game in python utilising the pygame package, the assignment expected a card game with algorithms of shuffling, dealing, keeping track of player hands and determining winners of each round, it also had to be user friendly allowing players to easily deal cards and play them. I found this a fun challenge because it was my first time creating a game like this, my only other experience that I had was that I previously made a simple snake game, so this was a big step up in technicality. 

Before development began, I drew a very simple idea of how I wanted the game to look in paint. This allowed me to constantly check it as a reference in development which helped a lot.

I created multiple classes to use a more object-oriented approach; I had the logic in its own sub class and the actual game was its parent. I found the positioning of each card where I wanted it challenging but I managed to get it to look how I wanted to with some trial and error.
